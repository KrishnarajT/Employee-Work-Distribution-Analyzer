# Employee-Work-Distribution-Analyzer
A script to make graphs by analyzing work done by employees in a Real company with limited control paramaters. 

# Graphs


# Installation

## For Usage
1. Just install the Exe file and put it a folder with your `Main.xlsx` file. 
2. Note that the name of the Excel sheet must be `Main.xlsx`. 
3. Just run the Executable. 
4. Make sure to follow the Excel sheet `Main.xlsx` exactly how it is. The Sheet names, variable names and position of columns are all hard coded, and should not be tampered with. 
5. Only edit the values in the actual rows. Preferable with drop down menus. 

## For development
1. In case you cannot run the Executable, or you want to mess around with the source code, you can run the python script from the terminal. 
    `python main.py`
2. Before running files from the terminal make sure you have the necessary libraries in your virtual environment. 
3. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can get `requirements.txt` from this Repository. 

# TODO 
1. Add other ways to sort the graphs. 
2. Add options to change color schemes. 
3. Make GUI if needed.
