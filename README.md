# Installation

## For Usage
1. Just install the Exe file and put it a folder with your `Main.xlsx` file. 
2. Note that the name of the Excel sheet must be `Main.xlsx`. 
3. Just run the Executable. 

## For development
1. In case you cannot run the Executable, or you want to mess around with the source code, you can run the python script from the terminal. 
    `python main.py`
2. Before running files from the terminal make sure you have the necessary libraries in your virtual environment. 
3. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can get `requirements.txt` from this Repository. 

# TODO 
1. Add other ways to sort the graphs. 
2. Add options to change color schemes. 
3. Make GUI if needed.
